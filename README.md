# What is Archon?

Archon is an experimental Rust application focused on the concepts of Rust's security, async, multithreading, networking etc.

This application doesn't have a fixed development schedule or planning whatsoever. It serves the following purposes:

1. Learning about the above mentioned concepts of advanced Rust: security, async, multithreading, networking;
2. Getting used to using Rust quickly and efficiently;
3. Learning about both offensive and defensive security in a fun way that's practical and engaging;
4. In the future, this may evolve into a focused application that has a specific purpose and does something useful, but in the initial stages this is just an educational experiment.

# What stage is Archon at?

- Stage 1: Implement a basic HTTP request client, utilizing async/multithreading for making several requests at once.
